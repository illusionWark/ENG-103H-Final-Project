ENG 103H final project repository. Lock breaking game with score

This game will be similar to lock breaking arcade games, where you have to get the ring in a certain zone,
then hit a button to “crack the lock.” It will have all lights on, then will select one at random, make it a different color, 
then “spin” another light around the circle. If the user hits the correct input at the right time, 
then make the built-in LED blink equal to the number of points scored. 
If the player doesn’t do this, the board will play a sad sound, blink red, and make you lose all of your points.

The light will spin around in one of two directions, and the user must hit the right button correlating to the direction when the spinning light is on top of the selected light.
If that is the case, the user gets a point. If not, the user fails and loses all of their points.
